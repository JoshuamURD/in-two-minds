# The Unbearable Lightness of Being
This book tells the stories from many different characters perspectives with the unique twist that the author also breaks to speak about certain themes. It gives the sense that the characters are literary vehicles or puppets used by the author to explore certain themes. One of the more prominent themes being the fuzziness of right and wrong. The eternal being. A motif that was brought by Nietzche. The idea speculates whether morality should be viewed through the lens of whether life is ephemeral or repetitive. It's a thought experiment. If life were to be repeated ad infinitem, would you be content? Through this lens, you may make decisions differently. Another idea which i liked a lot is that life can either be lived in a epicurean manner with every pleasure being fulfilled but it takes you away from the earth and the ground or you may suffer and feel the hardships and their weight. Although, the idea was expressed a lot more beautifully than that. But in its essence, I do agree with it. I think that a life lived without suffering or in complete euphoria is no life at all. Without hardships, what's the point?
